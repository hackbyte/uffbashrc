some sort of an ultimate full featured bashrc ;)

Several years ago, some freak sat down thinking about what bash can do for hin.

Up ti this day, he was a user of the beloved tcsh and had scripted some enthusiastic nice scripts for convinience.

But, time goes on and several distributions started to use bash for every simple action the needed.

So, i sat down and tried do keep as much of my old stuf as i can port.
But bash can do a lot of things more...

So, the ultimate full features bashrc was born.....

And it's still rising. ;)
